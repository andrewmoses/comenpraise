#All hail the pow'r of Jesus' name!
All hail the pow'r of Jesus' name!
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Crown Him, ye martyrs of our God
Who from His altar call;
Extol the Stem of Jesse's rod,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Ye saints redeemed of Adam's race,
Ye ransomed from the fall;
Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Let every kindred, every tribe
On this terrestrial ball,
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Oh, that with yonder sacred throng
We at His feet may fall,
Join in the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all.
