#A King is born this day in Bethlehem
A King is born this day in Bethlehem,
Hallelujah! (Halle, hallelujah!)
No crown is worn but angels worship Him,
Hallelujah! (Halle, hallelujah!)
Almighty God, He was meek and mild,
Salvation comes through this holy Child.

***
A King is born, (He is in the manger now)
A King is born, (humbly come and humbly bow)
A tiny Lord, (He's reaching out His tiny hand)
A King is born on this day, in Bethlehem.
***

His palace is lowly, His throne is made of hay,
Hallelujah! (Halle, hallelujah!)
Shepherds bow down to see His holy face,
Hallelujah! (Halle, hallelujah!)
Heaven is singing of peace on earth,
Filled with the wonder of this birth.

***
Come humbly and humbly bow,
He's in the manger now. - 4
