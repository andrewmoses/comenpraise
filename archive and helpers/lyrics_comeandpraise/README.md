Put the songs in the "pgmfolder" with .txt extension.
execute tojson.py - it will overwrite the contents of extracted.json - so execute it with caution.

Plan was to execute and manually add it to the exisitng json file.
Or we can keep adding the files to the "pgmfolder" and execute it without removing the previous song tracks, only one catch is the json will be generated from the beginning again and again.

Need to work on automating this problem.
